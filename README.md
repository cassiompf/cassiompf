### About Me
My name is Cássio, I am 19 years old and I currently work as a fullstack web developer. You can find me on almost all social networks by @cassiompf, I use it for everything.

### Stack
I can program anything, because i love to code and learn. But i'm already know and enjoy: **VueJS, VanillaJS, Java, CSS+HTML, NodeJS, Ruby On Rails and Python**.

### First contact with programming
The first programming language that I had contact with was Java and you may have noticed this, I think because of the amount of projects I did using this language. Over time I migrated to the web and saw that using Java for website creation would not be a great option in which I would feel comfortable programming for the website. So I got to know new technologies like html, css, javascript and currently I use Vuejs for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend.
